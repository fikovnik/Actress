## About ##

To cope with evolving requirements and environmental conditions, software systems must be adaptive. A common approach to developing self-adaptive systems is to architect them around feedback control loops (FCLs). While advances have led to more explicit and safer design of some control architectures, there is still a lack of comprehensive support for architecting both the control (decision making) and the integration (monitoring, reconfiguration) parts of FCLs into the targeted systems. To address this problem we provide a toolchain, ACTRESS, that enables software architects to design and integrate feedback control loops using model-driven engineering techniques. The toolchain relies on a reflective, fine-grained design and runtime modeling environment for feedback control architectures that permits us to build complex solutions with hierarchical layers of control loops. It consists of 

* a DSL to architect, reuse and program loop elements
* a support for verification using a variety of techniques that enables one to easily check different structural and behavioral properties on FCLs, and 
* an actor-oriented runtime environment.

ACTRESS Toolkit captures an outgoing work towards the goal of providing a model-driven development toolkit for designing, implementing and validating adaptive behavior that can be added on a top of existing computing systems thus turning them into self-adaptive systems.
This toolkit gives system administrators, control theorists and other computer scientists building blocks that allows them to quickly prototype and test adaptation strategies and abstracts them from the painful low-level implementation details.

ACTRESS is an MDE toolchain built using [SIGMA](http://fikovnik.net/Sigma).
